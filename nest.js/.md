# NestJS Interview Questions - Quick Answers

## **Foundational Questions (10)**

**1. What is NestJS and how does it differ from Express?**

NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework built on top of Express/Fastify that uses TypeScript by default and follows Angular-like architecture with decorators. Unlike Express which is minimalist and requires manual setup, NestJS provides built-in features like dependency injection, guards, interceptors, and follows a modular structure for enterprise-grade applications.

**2. Explain the basic building blocks of a NestJS application.**

- **Controllers**: Handle incoming HTTP requests and delegate to services.
- **Services**: Contain business logic and interact with data sources.
- **Modules**: Organize related code into cohesive blocks.
- **Guards**: Control access by handling authentication and authorization.
- **Interceptors**: Transform, log, or extend request/response processing.
- **Pipes**: Perform validation and transformation of incoming data.

**3. What is Dependency Injection in NestJS and why is it important?**

Dependency Injection is a design pattern where dependencies are provided to a class rather than created within it, managed by NestJS's IoC container. It promotes loose coupling, testability, and maintainability by allowing easy mocking of dependencies and centralized management of object lifecycles.

**4. How do you create and use a custom provider in NestJS?**

Custom providers are created using factory functions, class providers, or value providers registered in module's providers array. You can use `useFactory`, `useClass`, or `useValue` with optional injection tokens, allowing flexible dependency resolution and configuration-based instantiation.

**5. Explain the lifecycle of a NestJS application and its components.**

- **Module Initialization**: Registers and resolves module dependencies.
- **Provider Instantiation**: Creates instances of services and injectables.
- **Controller Creation**: Instantiates controllers with injected dependencies.
- **Application Bootstrap**: Final setup before the app starts handling requests.
- **`OnModuleInit` Hook**: Runs custom logic after a module's initialization.
- **`OnApplicationBootstrap` Hook**: Executes logic after the entire app is bootstrapped.
- **`OnModuleDestroy` Hook**: Handles cleanup when a module is being destroyed.

**6. How would you handle configuration in a NestJS application?**

Use `@nestjs/config` module with `ConfigModule.forRoot()` to load environment variables and configuration files. Create configuration schemas with validation, use `ConfigService` for type-safe access, and implement dynamic configurations for different environments.

**7. What are the different types of NestJS modules and when would you use each?**

Feature modules organize related functionality, shared modules export common services, global modules (`@Global()`) are available application-wide, and dynamic modules (`forRoot()`, `forFeature()`) accept configuration parameters. Use based on scope and reusability requirements.

**8. How does NestJS handle errors and exceptions?**

NestJS has built-in exception filters that catch and handle errors automatically, converting them to proper HTTP responses. You can create custom exception filters using `@Catch()` decorator, throw built-in HTTP exceptions, or implement global exception handling.

**9. What are Pipes in NestJS and how would you create a custom pipe?**

Pipes are classes that implement `PipeTransform` interface for data validation and transformation before reaching route handlers. Create custom pipes by implementing the `transform()` method and applying them using `@UsePipes()` decorator or parameter-level application.

**10. How do you implement request validation in NestJS?**

Use ValidationPipe with class-validator decorators on DTOs to automatically validate incoming requests. Configure global validation with `app.useGlobalPipes(new ValidationPipe())` and create custom validation rules using `@ValidatorConstraint()`.

## **Intermediate Questions (15)**

**11. Explain how NestJS interceptors work and provide a practical use case.**

Interceptors implement `NestInterceptor` interface to intercept and transform requests/responses using RxJS operators. Common use cases include logging, caching, response transformation, and adding execution time headers by manipulating the execution context.

**12. How would you implement role-based access control in NestJS?**

Create a roles guard that implements `CanActivate`, use `@Roles()` decorator on controllers/methods, and extract user roles from JWT tokens or session. The guard checks if user roles match required roles before allowing access to protected routes.

**13. What are the differences between middleware, guards, and interceptors in NestJS?**

Middleware runs before route handlers for general request processing, Guards determine if requests should proceed based on authorization logic, and Interceptors transform requests/responses with additional functionality. They execute in order: Middleware → Guards → Interceptors → Handler.

**14. How would you implement a caching mechanism in NestJS?**

Use `@nestjs/cache-manager` with `CacheModule.register()`, apply `@UseInterceptors(CacheInterceptor)` for automatic caching, or inject `CACHE_MANAGER` for manual cache operations. Configure TTL, storage backends (Redis, memory), and custom cache keys.

**15. How would you implement file uploads in NestJS?**

Use `@UseInterceptors(FileInterceptor())` or `FilesInterceptor()` with multer configuration for single/multiple file uploads. Access uploaded files via `@UploadedFile()` decorator, configure storage options, file filters, and size limits for secure file handling.

**16. How would you implement database transactions in NestJS?**

Use TypeORM's `QueryRunner` or `EntityManager.transaction()` method to wrap database operations in transactions. Implement transaction decorators or inject transaction-aware repositories to ensure data consistency across multiple database operations.

**17. What strategies would you use to optimize NestJS application performance?**

Implement caching layers, use database connection pooling, enable compression middleware, implement pagination, use lazy loading for modules, optimize database queries, and implement horizontal scaling with load balancers.

**18. How would you implement real-time communication in NestJS?**

Use `@nestjs/websockets` with Socket.IO or native WebSockets, create gateways with `@WebSocketGateway()` decorator, handle events with `@SubscribeMessage()`, and implement authentication/authorization for WebSocket connections.

**19. How would you implement rate limiting in NestJS?**

Use `@nestjs/terminus` package to create health check controllers with database, HTTP, and custom health indicators. Configure readiness and liveness probes for Kubernetes deployments with detailed service status reporting.

**21. What is the purpose of ExecutionContext in NestJS and how would you use it?**

ExecutionContext provides runtime information about the current request context (HTTP, WebSocket, gRPC), allowing guards and interceptors to access request/response objects, handler metadata, and make context-aware decisions.

**22. How would you implement a custom decorator in NestJS?**

Create parameter decorators using `createParamDecorator()` to extract data from requests, method decorators using `SetMetadata()` for adding metadata, or combine decorators using `applyDecorators()` for reusable functionality.

**23. Explain how you would structure a large-scale NestJS application.**

Organize by feature modules with shared/common modules, implement domain-driven design with bounded contexts, separate concerns using layers (controllers, services, repositories), and use monorepo structure with separate packages for different domains.

**51** inject vs injectable vs inject repository in NestJS

@Injectable() marks a class as a provider, making it available for dependency injection.

@Inject(AreaService) is used to inject a specific dependency, like AreaService, into a class.

@InjectRepository(Office) is specifically for injecting database repositories, which are crucial for data access. These decorators facilitate the inversion of control, where dependencies are managed by the NestJS IoC container. This approach promotes modularity and testability by decoupling components.
