### 1. **What is NestJS and how does it differ from Express?**

**Answer:**

NestJS is a **progressive Node.js framework** built on top of **Express.js** (or optionally Fastify) for building efficient, scalable, and maintainable server-side applications. It leverages **TypeScript** by default and uses **decorators** and **dependency injection** (DI) to simplify the development process.

- **Differences with Express:**
  - **NestJS** is a full-fledged framework that encourages modular development, comes with out-of-the-box support for **dependency injection**, **middleware**, **guards**, **interceptors**, **pipes**, and **DTOs**.
  - **Express**, on the other hand, is a minimalistic framework focused on request handling and routing, requiring more custom setup for complex features.

### 2. **What are modules in NestJS, and why are they important?**

**Answer:**

Modules in NestJS are the building blocks of an application. A module is simply a class annotated with the @Module() decorator. It is used to organize and group related functionality together (e.g., controllers, services, and other modules).

A module can import other modules and expose certain parts (like controllers and providers) to be used elsewhere in the app. The modular system makes the application more maintainable and scalable.

### 3. **Explain Dependency Injection in NestJS and how it works.**

**Answer:**

**Dependency Injection (DI)** is a design pattern used to reduce coupling between components and enhance testability. In NestJS, DI allows you to inject services (providers) into classes (such as controllers or other services) automatically.

- Providers are registered in the module and can be injected into the constructor of other classes.
- You can use @Injectable() to define a service that can be injected and constructor injection to automatically instantiate and inject the service when needed.

**Example:**

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class MyService {
  constructor(private readonly anotherService: AnotherService) {}
}
```

### 4. **What is a DTO (Data Transfer Object) and why do we use them in NestJS?**

**Answer:**

A **DTO (Data Transfer Object)** is an object that defines the shape of data being sent over the network, often used in API requests and responses. In NestJS, DTOs are typically used to validate, type, and ensure data integrity for incoming HTTP requests.

- DTOs are typically created as **classes** and decorated with validation decorators like @IsString() , @IsInt(), etc., using the class-validator package.
- They can be used in controllers as method parameter types to validate the data before passing it to the service layer.

**Example:**

```typescript
import { IsString, IsInt } from "class-validator";

export class CreateUserDto {
  @IsString()
  name: string;

  @IsInt()
  age: number;
}
```

### 5. **What is the role of Middleware in NestJS?**

**Answer:**

Middleware functions in NestJS are used to process requests before they reach the route handlers. They are typically used for tasks such as logging, authentication, parsing request bodies, or modifying request objects.

- Middleware is applied globally or locally (to specific routes).
- It is registered in the module and can be executed in a specific order.

**Example:**

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class LoggerMiddleware implements NestMiddleware {
  use(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
    console.log(`Request... ${req.method} ${req.url}`);
    next();
  }
}

@Module({
  providers: [LoggerMiddleware],
})
export class AppModule {
  configure(consumer: MiddlewareConsumer) {
    consumer.apply(LoggerMiddleware).forRoutes("*");
  }
}
```

### 6. **What is the difference between @Inject() and @Injectable() in NestJS?**

**Answer:**

- **@Injectable()**: This decorator marks a class as a provider (service). It's used to tell NestJS that the class can be injected into other classes.
- **@Inject()**: This decorator is used in cases where NestJS doesn't automatically infer the dependency. It allows you to specify a provider to inject when Nest can't deduce it automatically (e.g., for tokens or custom providers).

**Example of @Inject()**:

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class MyService {
  constructor(
    @Inject("CUSTOM_PROVIDER") private readonly myDependency: CustomService
  ) {}
}
```

### 7. **How does exception handling work in NestJS?**

**Answer:**
In NestJS, exception handling is provided through built-in **filters**. An exception filter is a class annotated with @Catch() that can handle specific types of exceptions.

NestJS has several built-in exception filters, such as HttpException, BadRequestException and others, but you can also create custom ones.

- **Default Error Handling**: When an error occurs, NestJS automatically sends an HTTP response with an appropriate status code and message.
- **Custom Exception Filters**: You can define your own exception filter to catch specific errors and customize the response.

**Example**:

```typescript
@Catch(HttpException)
export class HttpExceptionFilter implements ExceptionFilter {
  catch(exception: HttpException, response: Response) {
    const status = exception.getStatus();
    const message = exception.getResponse();
    response.status(status).json({ statusCode: status, message });
  }
}
```

### 8. **Explain Guards in NestJS. How are they different from Middleware?**

**Answer:**
**Guards** are used to handle authorization and request validation before the request is passed to the route handler. They are typically used for tasks like **authentication**, **role-based access control**, or **route guards** in GraphQL resolvers.

- Guards are executed **before** the request is handled by the controller, but after middleware.
- They return a **boolean** or a **Promise/Observable** indicating whether the request should continue or be denied.

**Example of a Guard**:

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class RolesGuard implements CanActivate {
  canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): boolean {
    const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
    return request.user.role === "admin";
  }
}
```

**Difference from Middleware**:

- **Middleware**: Used for request preprocessing (e.g., logging, parsing).
- **Guards**: Primarily used for **authorization and validation** before request handling.

### 9. **What is an Interceptor in NestJS, and when would you use one?**

**Answer:**
**Interceptors** are used to **intercept** the incoming request or outgoing response. They allow you to modify the request/response or even completely replace the response, and they can be used for:

- Logging
- Transformation (e.g., transforming response data format)
- Caching
- Error handling

Interceptors can also be used for **adding headers**, **logging performance** metrics, or **manipulating the response**.

**Example**:

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class LoggingInterceptor implements NestInterceptor {
  intercept(context: ExecutionContext, next: CallHandler): Observable<any> {
    const now = Date.now();
    return next
      .handle()
      .pipe(tap(() => console.log(`Request handled in ${Date.now() - now}ms`)));
  }
}
```

### 10. **How does NestJS support testing?**

**Answer:**
NestJS provides an integrated testing framework that uses **Jest** (or Mocha) for unit and integration tests. It provides utilities like Test.createTestingModule() to create a testing module, and it supports **dependency injection** and mock providers.

- **Unit Testing**: You can mock dependencies using Jest's mocking utilities.
- **Integration Testing**: You can test controllers, services, and modules by creating a fully functional app for the test.

**Example** (testing a service):

```typescript
import { Test, TestingModule } from "@nestjs/testing";
import { MyService } from "./my.service";

describe("MyService", () => {
  let service: MyService;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    const module: TestingModule = await Test.createTestingModule({
      providers: [MyService],
    }).compile();

    service = module.get<MyService>(MyService);
  });

  it("should be defined", () => {
    expect(service).toBeDefined();
  });
});
```
