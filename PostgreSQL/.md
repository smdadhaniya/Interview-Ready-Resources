- **TEXT:** Variable-length without specific limit

**Explanation:** Choose CHAR for fixed-length data, VARCHAR when you need length limits, and TEXT for variable-length text without restrictions.

### 7. What is a Primary Key in PostgreSQL?
**Answer:** A Primary Key is a constraint that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It cannot contain NULL values and must be unique across all rows.

**Explanation:** Primary keys automatically create a unique index and are essential for replication and foreign key relationships.

### 8. What is a Foreign Key?
**Answer:** A Foreign Key is a constraint that establishes a link between two tables by referencing the primary key of another table.

**Explanation:** Foreign keys maintain referential integrity by ensuring that values in the foreign key column exist in the referenced table's primary key column.

### 9. What are PostgreSQL schemas?
**Answer:** Schemas are logical containers that organize database objects like tables, views, and functions within a database.

**Explanation:** Schemas provide namespace separation, allowing multiple users to work without naming conflicts and enabling better organization of database objects.

### 10. What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE?
**Answer:**
- **DELETE:** Removes specific rows based on conditions, can be rolled back, slower
- **TRUNCATE:** Removes all rows from a table, faster, cannot be rolled back in some cases

**Explanation:** Use DELETE for selective removal and TRUNCATE for quickly emptying entire tables.

### 11. What are PostgreSQL indexes?
**Answer:** Indexes are database objects that improve query performance by creating a separate structure that points to table rows.
