);

INSERT INTO employees (name, department, salary) VALUES
('Alice', 'IT', 70000),
('Bob', 'HR', 50000),
('Carol', 'IT', 80000);
```

**Read data with conditions:**

```sql
SELECT name, salary FROM employees WHERE department = 'IT' ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 3;
```

**Update salaries for HR employees:**

```sql
UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 1.1 WHERE department = 'HR';
```

**Delete low salary employees:**

```sql
DELETE FROM employees WHERE salary < 60000;
```

**Upsert example:**

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, salary) VALUES (2, 'Bob', 55000)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET salary = EXCLUDED.salary;

| **FULL JOIN**    | All rows from both tables, NULL where no match.                         | `SELECT * FROM employees FULL JOIN departments ON employees.dept_id = departments.id;`                         |
| **CROSS JOIN**   | Cartesian product of both tables (all combinations).                    | `SELECT * FROM employees CROSS JOIN departments;`                                                              |
| **SELF JOIN**    | Joins table to itself for hierarchical or comparative queries.          | `SELECT e1.name AS manager, e2.name AS employee FROM employees e1 JOIN employees e2 ON e1.id = e2.manager_id;` |
| **NATURAL JOIN** | Joins on all columns with the same name automatically.                  | `SELECT * FROM employees NATURAL JOIN departments;`                                                            |

## 5. Relationships

| Relationship Type       | Description                                                           | Example/Use Case                                                                          |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **One-to-One (1:1)**    | Each row in A corresponds to one row in B, and vice versa.            | User and their unique passport record.                                                    |
| **One-to-Many (1\:N)**  | One row in A corresponds to many rows in B.                           | One department has many employees.                                                        |
| **Many-to-One (N:1)**   | Many rows in A relate to one row in B (inverse of 1\:N).              | Many employees belong to one department.                                                  |
| **Many-to-Many (M\:N)** | Multiple rows in A relate to multiple rows in B via a junction table. | Students enrolled in many courses, and courses have many students (via enrollment table). |
| **Self-Referencing**    | Table relates to itself for hierarchies.                              | Employees with managers who are also employees.                                           |

**Implementation Tips:**

- Use **`FOREIGN KEY`** constraints for One-to-Many.
- Use **junction tables** with two foreign keys for Many-to-Many.
- Use **`UNIQUE` + `FOREIGN KEY`** for One-to-One.
- Use self-joins and foreign keys on the same table for self-referencing relationships.

| **Trigger**          | Automatic procedure invoked BEFORE/AFTER INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE on a table. | `CREATE TRIGGER log_update BEFORE UPDATE ON employees FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION log_changes();`                                                    |
| **Trigger Function** | Function executed by the trigger (usually PL/pgSQL).                        | `sql CREATE FUNCTION log_changes() RETURNS trigger AS $$ BEGIN INSERT INTO audit_table VALUES (NEW.id, now()); RETURN NEW; END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql; ` |
| **Timing**           | When trigger fires: BEFORE, AFTER, INSTEAD OF (for views).                  | BEFORE INSERT, AFTER UPDATE                                                                                                                            |
| **Level**            | Granularity: FOR EACH ROW or FOR EACH STATEMENT (once per query).           | FOR EACH ROW                                                                                                                                           |
| **Use Cases**        | Auditing, validation, enforcing rules, cascading changes.                   | Automatically update timestamp columns, maintain audit logs.                                                                                           |

## 8. Exercises for Practice

| Level      | Task Description                                                                                                                                   | Hint / Goal                                                 |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Easy**   | Create a table `employees` with columns: id, name, department, salary. Add NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints.                                        | Practice table creation and constraints.                    |
| **Medium** | Write a query to find the average salary per department with a HAVING clause filtering departments with > 3 employees.                             | Practice GROUP BY and HAVING.                               |
| **Medium** | Write a query using CASE to categorize employees by salary (Low, Medium, High).                                                                    | Practice conditional expressions in SELECT.                 |
| **Hard**   | Create a trigger that logs all salary updates in a separate audit table.                                                                           | Practice creating trigger functions and attaching triggers. |
| **Hard**   | Design a many-to-many relationship between `students` and `courses` tables using a junction table. Insert sample data and query enrolled students. | Practice relationships and joins.                           |

- **Indexes** (Critical for performance)
  Add a section explaining how and when to create indexes, plus examples:

  - Types: B-tree, GIN, GiST, Hash, BRIN
  - Syntax: `CREATE INDEX idx_name ON table(column);`
  - Unique indexes
  - Partial indexes
  - When NOT to use indexes (to avoid overhead)

- **Views** (Virtual tables for abstraction)
  Brief intro to views and materialized views:

  - `CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT ...`
  - When to use materialized views vs regular views

- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** â€” You already have a mention under clauses, but maybe a short dedicated section with recursive CTE examples could help advanced learners.

- **JSON/JSONB Support** â€” PostgreSQLâ€™s powerful support for semi-structured data is a huge feature.
  Include basics like storing JSON, querying JSON fields with `->`, `->>`, `jsonb_each()`, indexing JSONB, etc.

- **Backup & Restore** â€” Basic commands for `pg_dump`, `pg_restore`, `psql` utilities â€” critical for DB admins.

## 9. Indexes

| Type              | Description                                                  | Example                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **B-tree**        | Default, balanced tree index for equality and range queries. | `CREATE INDEX idx_salary ON employees(salary);`              |
| **Unique Index**  | Enforces uniqueness on columns.                              | `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_email ON users(email);`             |
| **GIN**           | Good for array and full-text search.                         | `CREATE INDEX idx_tags ON articles USING GIN(tags);`         |
| **Partial Index** | Index only subset of rows.                                   | `CREATE INDEX idx_active ON employees(salary) WHERE active;` |

## 10. Views

```sql
CREATE VIEW high_earners AS
SELECT name, salary FROM employees WHERE salary > 70000;
```

- Use views to simplify complex queries and enforce security.

## 11. JSON / JSONB Data Type

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  data JSONB
);

INSERT INTO orders (data) VALUES
('{"item": "book", "quantity": 3}');
```

Query JSON data:

```sql
SELECT data->>'item' AS item_name FROM orders WHERE data->>'item' = 'book';
```
