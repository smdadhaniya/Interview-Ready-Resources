### 1. Core Principles of OOP

### **Encapsulation**

Encapsulation refers to the binding of data (variables) and methods (functions) that manipulate the data into a single unit (a class). It hides the internal state of an object and only exposes the necessary operations through methods, ensuring that sensitive data is protected from external access.

### **Abstraction**

Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by hiding unnecessary details and only showing the essential parts to the user. In OOP, abstraction is implemented through classes and interfaces, which expose only relevant methods and properties.

### **Polymorphism**

Polymorphism allows methods to behave differently based on the context. It comes in two types:

- **Compile-Time Polymorphism**: Achieved through method overloading (methods with the same name but different parameters).
- **Runtime Polymorphism**: Achieved through method overriding (redefining methods in derived classes).

### **Inheritance**

Inheritance enables a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. It helps create a hierarchy and promotes code reusability.

### 2. What is a Class in OOP?

A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects (instances). It defines the properties and behaviors (methods) that the created objects will have. In essence, a class acts as a template for creating objects with common characteristics and behavior.

### Example:

```javascript
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
  }
}
```

## 3. What is an Object?

An **object** is an instance of a class. It represents real-world entities with specific properties and behaviors. When you create an object, you are essentially creating a unique instance of a class, with its own state (data) and functionality (methods).

### Example:

```javascript
const dog = new Animal("Buddy");
dog.speak(); // Output: Buddy makes a sound.
```

## 4. Difference Between call(), apply(), and bind()

These are methods used to set the this context within a function, and they behave slightly differently.

### **call()**

The call() method allows you to invoke a function with a specified this value and arguments passed individually.

#### Example:

```javascript
function greet(message) {
  console.log(this.name + " says: " + message);
}

const person = { name: "John" };
greet.call(person, "Hello!"); // Output: John says: Hello!
```

### **apply()**

The apply() method works similarly to call(), but instead of passing arguments individually, you pass an array (or array-like object) of arguments.

#### Example:

```javascript
greet.apply(person, ["Hi there!"]); // Output: John says: Hi there!
```

### **bind()**

The bind() method returns a new function that, when invoked, has its this value set to the provided value and its arguments pre-filled (partially applied).

#### Example:

```javascript
const greetJohn = greet.bind(person, "Hey there!");
greetJohn(); // Output: John says: Hey there!
```

### 5. What is constructor?

**Answers**:

A constructor is a special function that creates and initializes an object instance of a class

### 6. What is destructor in oops?

**Answers**:

A destructor is a member function that is invoked automatically when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly destroyed by a call to delete or delete[]
