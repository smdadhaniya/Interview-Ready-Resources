### **1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**

**Answer:**
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects." These objects represent real-world entities and consist of two main components:

- **Properties (or attributes)**: Data about the object.
- **Methods (or behaviors)**: Actions that the object can perform.

The main goals of OOP are to improve code reusability, scalability, and maintainability by organizing code into objects and classes.

### **2. What are the four core principles of OOP?**

**Answer:**
The four main principles of OOP are:

1. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit, it is the mechanism that binds together code and the data.

2. **Abstraction**: Abstraction means showing only the essential details to the user, hiding the complex details. In OOP, it is achieved through interfaces or abstract classes.

- **Data Abstraction**
- **Process Abstraction**

3. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism allows different objects to be treated as instances of the same class through shared methods, even if they are of different types. It enables the same function or method to behave differently depending on the object.

- **Poly:** many + **Morph:** forms = **Polymorphism:** Many forms

4. **Inheritance**: Inheritance is a mechanism in OOP where a new class (child class) can inherit the properties and behaviors of an existing class (parent class). This allows the child class to reuse code from the parent class while adding its own functionality.

### **3. What is a Class in OOP?**

**Answer:**
A **class** is a blueprint or template for creating objects (instances). It defines the attributes and methods that the objects created from it will have. Think of a class like a blueprint for a house, and objects are the actual houses built from that blueprint.

- **Example**:

```javascript
class Car {
  constructor(brand, model) {
    this.brand = brand;
    this.model = model;
  }

  drive() {
    console.log(`${this.brand} ${this.model} is driving.`);
  }
}

const myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla");
myCar.drive(); // Output: Toyota Corolla is driving.
```

### **4. What is an Object in OOP?**

**Answer:**
An **object** is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity with actual values and behaviors. When you create an object from a class, it has its own unique data (state) and can perform actions (methods).

- **Example**:

```javascript
const dog = new Animal("Buddy");
dog.speak(); // Output: Buddy makes a sound.
```

Here, `dog` is an object of the `Animal` class.

### **5. What is the difference between `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()` in JavaScript?**

**Answer:**

- **`call()`**: This method calls a function with a specified `this` value and arguments passed individually. It executes the function immediately.

  - **Example**:

  ```javascript
  function greet(message) {
    console.log(this.name + " says: " + message);
  }
  const person = { name: "John" };
  greet.call(person, "Hello!"); // Output: John says: Hello!
  ```

- **`apply()`**: Similar to `call()`, but instead of passing arguments individually, you pass an array (or array-like object) of arguments. It also calls the function immediately.

  - **Example**:

  ```javascript
  greet.apply(person, ["Hi there!"]); // Output: John says: Hi there!
  ```

- **`bind()`**: This method returns a new function that, when invoked, has its `this` value set to the specified object and can optionally preset arguments. It doesn't execute the function immediately but instead returns a function to be called later.

  - **Example**:

  ```javascript
  const greetJohn = greet.bind(person, "Hey there!");
  greetJohn(); // Output: John says: Hey there!
  ```

### **6. What is a Constructor in OOP?**

**Answer:**
A **constructor** is a special method in a class that is automatically called when an object of that class is created. It is used to initialize the object's properties with default or passed values.

- **Example**:

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}

const john = new Person("John", 30);
console.log(john.name); // Output: John
console.log(john.age); // Output: 30
```

---

### **7. What is a Destructor in OOP?**

**Answer:**
A **destructor** is a special method that is invoked when an object is destroyed or goes out of scope. In some languages, destructors are used to clean up resources, such as closing database connections or releasing memory.

- **Example**: In languages like C++ or Python, destructors automatically handle cleanup when an object is deleted or goes out of scope.

In JavaScript, destructors are not needed explicitly as garbage collection handles memory management.

### **8. What is the difference between Method Overloading and Method Overriding?**

**Answer:**

- **Method Overloading**: Involves defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. Itâ€™s commonly used in languages like Java or C++.

  - **Example** (Java):

  ```java
  class Printer {
    void print(String text) {
      System.out.println(text);
    }

    void print(int number) {
      System.out.println(number);
    }
  }
  ```

- **Method Overriding**: Occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.

  - **Example**:

  ```javascript
  class Animal {
    speak() {
      console.log("Animal makes a sound");
    }
  }

  class Dog extends Animal {
    speak() {
      console.log("Dog barks");
    }
  }

  const dog = new Dog();
  dog.speak(); // Output: Dog barks
  ```

### **9. What is Polymorphism?**

**Answer:**
**Polymorphism** allows methods to be used in different ways depending on the object. It helps in achieving flexibility and reusability in code. Polymorphism can be categorized into:

- **Compile-time polymorphism** (method overloading).
- **Runtime polymorphism** (method overriding).

- **Example**:

```javascript
class Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log("Animal speaks");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log("Dog barks");
  }
}

const animal = new Animal();
const dog = new Dog();

animal.speak(); // Output: Animal speaks
dog.speak(); // Output: Dog barks
```
