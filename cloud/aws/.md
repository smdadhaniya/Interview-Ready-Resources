### 1. **What is the difference between Amazon EC2 and AWS Lambda?**

**Answer:**
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) and AWS Lambda are both compute services offered by AWS, but they differ significantly in how they are provisioned, managed, and billed.

- **Amazon EC2**: EC2 is a virtual server that runs applications on-demand. It provides a high level of control over the operating system and the software stack. EC2 instances require manual scaling, as they are provisioned and managed by the user, meaning users are billed based on the instance type and the running time. It is suitable for applications that need a persistent runtime environment.

- **AWS Lambda**: Lambda is a serverless compute service that automatically runs code in response to events and automatically manages the compute resources. Unlike EC2, Lambda abstracts the underlying infrastructure, allowing developers to focus purely on writing functions. It charges based on the number of requests and the duration of execution, making it cost-effective for short-lived or infrequent workloads. Lambda is ideal for event-driven applications, microservices, and tasks that require scaling based on events, such as file uploads to S3 or API requests.

### 2. **What is Amazon VPC, and why is it used?**

**Answer:**
Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a networking service that allows users to create a logically isolated network environment within the AWS cloud. It is used to launch AWS resources such as EC2 instances, databases, and other services in a virtual network that is defined by the user. The primary purpose of VPC is to provide enhanced control over network configurations, such as IP address ranges, subnets, route tables, and network gateways, allowing you to isolate, secure, and connect resources in a way that mirrors on-premises networks.

### 3. **Explain the concept of Auto Scaling in AWS and how it works.**

**Answer:**
AWS Auto Scaling is a service that automatically adjusts the capacity of compute resources based on predefined criteria, such as CPU utilization or network traffic. It is designed to ensure that the application has the necessary resources to handle varying loads, while also reducing costs by scaling down when demand decreases.

Auto Scaling works by monitoring specific metrics (e.g., CPU usage, memory usage, or application-level metrics), and if the metric crosses a threshold, Auto Scaling automatically adds or removes instances. This helps maintain application performance while optimizing resource usage.

### 4. **What is the role of IAM (Identity and Access Management) in AWS?**

**Answer:**
AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a crucial security service that enables the management of access to AWS resources. It allows the definition of users, groups, roles, and permissions, thereby controlling who can access AWS resources and what actions they can perform. IAM ensures the principle of least privilege by allowing fine-grained access control to resources.

### 5. **What is Amazon S3, and what are its main use cases?**

**Answer:**
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a highly scalable, durable, and low-latency object storage service provided by AWS. It is designed to store large amounts of data, including static files such as images, videos, backups, and logs. S3 provides virtually unlimited storage and is often used for data archiving, content distribution, and as a backup solution.

### 6. **What is CloudFormation, and how does it help in AWS infrastructure management?**

**Answer:**
AWS CloudFormation is a service that enables users to define, provision, and manage AWS infrastructure as code. Using CloudFormation, users can create and manage a collection of AWS resources (such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, VPCs, and more) in an automated and repeatable manner, all from a declarative template.
