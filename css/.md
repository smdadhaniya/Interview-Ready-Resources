### 2. What is the difference between display: none; and visibility: hidden

- Visibility: hidden: The element is still present in the document flow, but it is invisible. It occupies space on the page, but you cannot see it

### 3.  Explain the difference between position: relative; and position: absolute; in CSS

**Answer:**

- **Relative**: The element stays in the document flow (other elements will still be affected by it), but you can move it around using top, right, bottom, and left properties. It moves relative to where it would normally be.

- **Absolute**: The element is taken out of the document flow (it doesn't affect other elements), and itâ€™s positioned based on the nearest positioned ancestor (an element with position: relative, absolute, or fixed). If no such ancestor, it positions relative to the document body.

### 4. What are vh and vw in CSS?

- VW (viewport width): Represents a percentage of the viewport width. 1vw is equal to 1% of the viewport width.

### 5. What is the purpose of z-index in CSS?
**Answer:**

z-index is used to specify the stack order of elements that overlap. The z-index property only works on positioned elements (position is set to relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky).

A higher z-index means the element will appear in front of elements with lower z-index values.
Elements with the same z-index will be stacked in the order they appear in the HTML

### 6. Difference between margin vs padding
