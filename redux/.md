### 1. What is Redux, and why would you use it?

**Answer:**
Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications, commonly used with React. It provides a predictable state container, allowing you to manage the application state globally. You would use Redux to simplify state management, especially in large applications where prop drilling can become cumbersome.

### 2. What are actions in Redux?

**Answer:**
Actions are plain JavaScript objects that describe an event that has occurred in the application. Each action must have a type property, and can optionally contain additional data (payload) to provide more context. Actions are dispatched to trigger state changes in the store.

### 3. What are reducers in Redux?

**Answer:**
Reducers are pure functions that take the current state and an action as arguments and return a new state. They specify how the state changes in response to actions. Reducers must not mutate the existing state but should create a new object to represent the updated state.

### 4. What is the Redux store, and how do you create it?

**Answer:**
The Redux store is an object that holds the application state. It is created using the createStore function from Redux, which takes a reducer as its argument and optionally middleware.

### 5. What is the purpose of the Provider component in Redux?

**Answer:**
The Provider component is a React component that makes the Redux store available to all nested components. It wraps your main application component and passes the store to the context, allowing any connected components to access the store.

### 6. What is the difference between action creators and reducers?

**Answer:**
Action Creators: Functions that return action objects. They encapsulate the logic of creating actions, often including any necessary payload data. Action creators can also be asynchronous when used with middleware like redux-thunk.

Reducers: Functions that take the current state and an action as arguments and return a new state. They determine how the state changes in response to the dispatched actions

### 7. What is the role of the Redux DevTools?

**Answer:**
Redux DevTools is a browser extension that provides a powerful interface for debugging Redux applications. It allows you to inspect every action and state change, revert to previous states, and even time travel through state changes. It can help in understanding how actions affect the state and in identifying bugs.

### 8. Can you explain the combineReducers function in Redux?

**Answer:**
The combineReducers function is used to combine multiple reducers into a single reducing function. Each reducer is responsible for a specific slice of the state, and combineReducers creates a root reducer that can manage the overall state. The state tree will have a structure based on the keys provided to combineReducers

### 9. How do you handle asynchronous actions with Redux Toolkit?

**Answer:**
You can handle asynchronous actions using createAsyncThunk, which allows you to define async actions easily. It automatically generates action types and reducers for the pending, fulfilled, and rejected states.
