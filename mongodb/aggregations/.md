### 1. **$match**

The $match stage filters documents based on a condition, similar to a find() query.

**Example:**  
Find all users who are 18 years or older:

```js
{
  $match: {
    age: {
      $gte: 18;
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. **$project**

The $project stage reshapes each document, either by including/excluding fields or by applying expressions to modify or create new fields.

**Example:**  
Include only name and age, and add a new field isAdult that checks if age >= 18:

```js
{
  $project: {
    name: 1,
    age: 1,
    isAdult: { $gte: ["$age", 18] }
  }
}
```

---

### 3. **$group**

The $group stage groups documents by a specified identifier and allows you to apply aggregation operations (like sum, average, count).

**Example:**  
Group users by age and calculate the total number of users and the average salary:

```js
{
  $group: {
    _id: "$age",
    totalCount: { $sum: 1 },
    avgSalary: { $avg: "$salary" }
  }
}
```

---

### 4. **$sort**

The $sort stage sorts documents by specified fields.

**Example:**  
Sort by age in descending order and name in ascending order:

```js
{
  $sort: { age: -1, name: 1 }
}
```

---

### 5. **$limit**

The $limit stage limits the number of documents passed to the next stage.

**Example:**  
Retrieve the first 5 documents:

```js
{
  $limit: 5;
}
```

---

### 6. **$skip**

The $skip stage skips over a specified number of documents.

**Example:**  
Skip the first 10 documents:

```js
{
  $skip: 10;
}
```

---

### 7. **$unwind**

The $unwind stage deconstructs an array field, creating a new document for each element in the array.

**Example:**  
Unwind the orders array so each order becomes its own document:

```js
{
  $unwind: "$orders";
}
```

---

### 8. **$lookup**

The $lookup stage performs a left outer join between collections. It combines documents from two collections based on a matching field.

**Example:**  
Join the users collection with the posts collection where userId in posts matches \_id in users:

```js
{
  $lookup: {
    from: "posts",
    localField: "_id",
    foreignField: "userId",
    as: "userPosts"
  }
}
```

---

### 9. **$addFields**

The $addFields stage adds new fields or modifies existing fields in the document.

**Example:**  
Add a new field fullName by concatenating firstName and lastName:

```js
{
  $addFields: {
    fullName: {
      $concat: ["$firstName", " ", "$lastName"];
    }
  }
}
```

---

### 10. **$replaceRoot**

The $replaceRoot stage replaces the root document with the value of a specified field.

**Example:**  
Replace the document with the value of the profile field:

```js
{
  $replaceRoot: {
    newRoot: "$profile";
  }
}
```

---

### 11. **$count**

The $count stage counts the number of documents in the pipeline and returns a document with the count.

**Example:**  
Count the number of users who are 18 years or older:

```js
{
  $match: { age: { $gte: 18 } }
},
{
  $count: "totalAdults"
}
```

---

### 12. **$facet**

The $facet stage allows multiple aggregation pipelines to run concurrently within the same stage.

**Example:**  
Get both the count of all users and the average age:

```js
{
  $facet: {
    totalUsers: [{ $count: "count" }],
    averageAge: [{ $group: { _id: null, avgAge: { $avg: "$age" } } }]
  }
}
```

---

### 13. **$bucket**

The $bucket stage groups documents into discrete buckets based on a specified range of values.

**Example:**  
Group users into age buckets:

```js
{
  $bucket: {
    groupBy: "$age",
    boundaries: [0, 18, 30, 40, 50, 60, 100],
    default: "Other",
    output: { count: { $sum: 1 } }
  }
}
```

---

### 14. **$bucketAuto**

The $bucketAuto stage automatically creates a specified number of buckets based on the distribution of field values.

**Example:**  
Create 4 buckets based on age:

```js
{
  $bucketAuto: {
    groupBy: "$age",
    buckets: 4,
    output: { count: { $sum: 1 } }
  }
}
```

---

### 15. **$geoNear**

The $geoNear stage finds documents based on proximity to a point. It requires a geospatial index on the field.

**Example:**  
Find documents that are within 5km of a given point:

```js
{
  $geoNear: {
    near: { type: "Point", coordinates: [-73.97, 40.77] },
    distanceField: "dist.calculated",
    maxDistance: 5000,
    spherical: true
  }
}
```

---

### 16. **$out**

The $out stage writes the results of the aggregation pipeline to a new collection, replacing it if it already exists.

**Example:**  
Write the aggregation results to the resultCollection:

```js
{
  $out: "resultCollection";
}
```

---

### 17. **$merge**

The $merge stage writes the output of the aggregation pipeline to a collection, with more options for controlling how the data is merged.

**Example:**  
Merge the aggregation result into the usersSummary collection:

```js
{
  $merge: {
    into: "usersSummary",
    whenMatched: "merge",
    whenNotMatched: "insert"
  }
}
```

---

### 18. **$sortByCount**

The $sortByCount stage is a shorthand for grouping by a field and then sorting by the count of each value.

```js
{
  $sortByCount: "$age";
}
```

---

### 19. **$sample**

The $sample stage selects a random sample of documents from the input dataset.

```js
{
  $sample: {
    size: 5;
  }
}
```

---

### 20. **$arrayToObject**

The $arrayToObject stage converts an array of key-value pairs into an object.

**Example:**  
Convert an array of key-value pairs into an object:

```js
{
  $project: {
    myObject: {
      $arrayToObject: [
        ["key1", "value1"],
        ["key2", "value2"],
      ];
    }
  }
}
```

---

### 21. **$objectToArray**

The $objectToArray stage converts an object to an array of key-value pairs.

**Example:**  
Convert an object into an array of key-value pairs:

```js
{
  $project: {
    safeDivision: {
      $tryCatch: {
        try: { $divide: [ "$total", "$count" ] },
        catch: 0
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

### 26. **$expr**

The $expr stage allows the use of aggregation expressions in query conditions. It is commonly used in $match to evaluate more complex conditions.

**Example:**  
Match documents where the age is greater than the minAge field:

```js
{
  $match: {
    $;

    expr: {
      $gt: ["$age", "$minAge"];
    }

```js
{
  $match: {
    age: {
      $in: [18, 25, 30];
    }
  }
}
```

---

### 31. **$and**
