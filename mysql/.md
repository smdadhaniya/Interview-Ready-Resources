### 1. What is the difference between INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN?

- **INNER JOIN**: Returns rows when there is a match in both tables. If there is no match, the row is not included.
- **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.
- **RIGHT JOIN**: Similar to LEFT JOIN, but returns all rows from the right table and matched rows from the left table.
- **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Returns rows when there is a match in either the left or right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for missing rows from either side.

**Example**:

```sql
-- INNER JOIN Example:
SELECT employees.name, departments.name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;

-- LEFT JOIN Example:
SELECT employees.name, departments.name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;

-- RIGHT JOIN Example:
SELECT employees.name, departments.name
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;

-- FULL OUTER JOIN Example:
SELECT employees.name, departments.name
FROM employees
FULL OUTER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

### 2. What are the differences between WHERE and HAVING clauses in SQL?

- **WHERE**: Filters rows before grouping. It applies to individual rows.
- **HAVING**: Filters groups after the GROUP BY operation. It applies to aggregated data.

**Example**:

```sql
-- WHERE filters individual rows:
SELECT name, age
FROM employees
WHERE age > 30;

-- HAVING filters aggregated groups:
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS num_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

---

### 3. **What is the difference between CHAR and VARCHAR data types?**

- **CHAR**: Fixed-length string. If the data is shorter than the defined length, it is padded with spaces.
- **VARCHAR**: Variable-length string. Only the required space is used for storage.

**Example**:

```sql
-- CHAR Example (5 characters fixed length):
CREATE TABLE example_char (
    name CHAR(5)
);

-- VARCHAR Example (variable length):
CREATE TABLE example_varchar (
    name VARCHAR(5)
);
```

### 4. **Explain the concept of normalization. What are the different normal forms?**

Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. The normal forms (NF) are a set of guidelines:

1. **1st Normal Form (1NF)**: Ensure each column contains atomic values (no arrays or lists).
2. **2nd Normal Form (2NF)**: Meet 1NF and remove partial dependencies (no non-key column depends on part of the primary key).
3. **3rd Normal Form (3NF)**: Meet 2NF and remove transitive dependencies (non-key columns shouldnâ€™t depend on other non-key columns).
4. **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**: A stronger version of 3NF; every determinant must be a candidate key.

**Example**: Consider a table with student and course data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE student_courses (
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    student_name VARCHAR(100),
    course_name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

This table violates 2NF because student_name depends on student_id, and course_name depends on course_id. To normalize:

- Split it into two tables: students and courses.

### 5. **What is an index, and why is it important?**

An index is a database object that improves the speed of data retrieval. It is created on one or more columns of a table to facilitate fast lookup. However, indexes slow down INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations because they need to be updated.

**Example**:

```sql
-- Creating an index:
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_name ON employees(name);

-- Query using the index:
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = 'John Doe';
```

---

### 6. **How do you optimize a slow-performing query in MySQL?**

- **Use EXPLAIN**: Use the EXPLAIN command to analyze the query plan and check for issues like full table scans or missing indexes.
- **Optimize Indexes**: Ensure indexes are used properly. Add indexes on columns used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses.

- **Limit the Result Set**: Use LIMIT when retrieving large datasets to prevent unnecessary data fetching.

- **Optimize Joins**: Avoid unnecessary joins. Use the most efficient join type.

**Example**:

```sql
-- Using EXPLAIN:
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = 3;
```

---

### 7. **What are primary keys and foreign keys?**

- **Primary Key**: A column (or set of columns) that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It cannot be NULL and must be unique.
- **Foreign Key**: A column that creates a relationship between two tables by referencing the primary key in another table.

**Example**:

```sql
-- Primary Key:
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Foreign Key:
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employees(id)
);
```

---

### 8. **What is the difference between TRUNCATE and DELETE in MySQL?**

- **TRUNCATE**: Removes all rows from a table and resets the auto-increment value (faster and does not generate individual row deletion logs).
- **DELETE**: Removes rows based on a condition and does not reset the auto-increment value. It can be rolled back if used within a transaction.

**Example**:

```sql
-- TRUNCATE Example:
TRUNCATE TABLE employees;

-- DELETE Example:
DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 5;
```

---

### 9. **Explain the concept of ACID properties in database transactions.**

- **Atomicity**: All operations in a transaction are completed, or none are. The transaction is atomic.
- **Consistency**: A transaction brings the database from one valid state to another.
- **Isolation**: Transactions are isolated from each other, ensuring that the intermediate state of a transaction is not visible to other transactions.
- **Durability**: Once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanent, even if there is a system failure.

---

### 10. **What are stored procedures and triggers in MySQL?**

- **Stored Procedure**: A precompiled collection of SQL statements that can be executed with a single call.
- **Trigger**: A set of SQL statements that automatically execute in response to certain events on a table (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).

**Example**:

```sql
-- Stored Procedure Example:
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeDetails(IN emp_id INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = emp_id;
END //
DELIMITER ;

-- Trigger Example:
CREATE TRIGGER before_insert_employee
BEFORE INSERT ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    SET NEW.created_at = NOW();
END;
```

---

### 11. **What is the difference between GROUP BY and ORDER BY?**

- **GROUP BY**: Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows (e.g., to calculate aggregates).
- **ORDER BY**: Orders the result set by one or more columns.

**Example**:

```sql
-- GROUP BY Example:
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS num_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;

-- ORDER BY Example:
SELECT name, age FROM employees ORDER BY age DESC;
```

---

### 12. **Explain the concept of a subquery. How is it different from a join?**

A **subquery** is a query nested inside another query, typically used to return a single value or a set of values. A **JOIN** is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

**Example**:

```sql
-- Subquery Example:
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = (SELECT id FROM departments WHERE name = 'HR');

-- JOIN Example:
SELECT employees.name, departments.name
FROM employees
JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```
