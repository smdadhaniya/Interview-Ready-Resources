### **JavaScript / Node.js Related Questions**

#### 1. **map / filter / reduce / find**

- **`map`**:

  - **Purpose**: Transforms elements in an array and returns a new array.
  - **Syntax**: `array.map(callback(currentValue, index, array))`
  - **Example**:
    ```javascript
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
    const squares = numbers.map((num) => num * num);
    console.log(squares); // [1, 4, 9]
    ```

- **`filter`**:

  - **Purpose**: Filters out elements from an array based on a condition and returns a new array.
  - **Syntax**: `array.filter(callback(currentValue, index, array))`
  - **Example**:
    ```javascript
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    const evenNumbers = numbers.filter((num) => num % 2 === 0);
    console.log(evenNumbers); // [2, 4]
    ```

- **`reduce`**:

  - **Purpose**: Reduces an array to a single value (e.g., sum, product).
  - **Syntax**: `array.reduce(callback(accumulator, currentValue, index, array), initialValue)`
  - **Example**:
    ```javascript
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
    console.log(sum); // 10
    ```

- **`find`**:
  - **Purpose**: Finds the first element in an array that satisfies a given condition.
  - **Syntax**: `array.find(callback(currentValue, index, array))`
  - **Example**:
    ```javascript
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    const firstEven = numbers.find((num) => num % 2 === 0);
    console.log(firstEven); // 2
    ```

#### 2. **SQL Joins (including Self Join)**

- **SQL Joins**:
  - **INNER JOIN**: Combines rows from both tables where there is a match.
  - **LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)**: Returns all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table (null if no match).
  - **RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**: Returns all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table (null if no match).
  - **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Returns rows when there is a match in one of the tables.
- **Self Join**:
  - A self join is when a table is joined with itself. It is used to compare rows within the same table.
  - **Example**:
    ```sql
    SELECT A.EmployeeName AS Employee, B.EmployeeName AS Manager
    FROM Employees A, Employees B
    WHERE A.ManagerID = B.EmployeeID;
    ```

---

#### 3. **MongoDB Aggregation**

MongoDB aggregation allows for data transformation and computation in MongoDB queries. It’s like SQL’s `GROUP BY` and `JOIN` combined.

- **Example**: Grouping and summing the values of a field.
  ```javascript
  db.orders.aggregate([
    { $group: { _id: "$category", totalSales: { $sum: "$amount" } } },
  ]);
  ```

---

#### 4. **Batch Operation in MongoDB**

Batch operations in MongoDB allow you to process multiple documents in one go.

- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  db.collection.bulkWrite([
    { insertOne: { document: { name: "Alice", age: 25 } } },
    { insertOne: { document: { name: "Bob", age: 30 } } },
  ]);
  ```

---

#### 5. **How to Optimize MongoDB Queries**

- **Indexes**: Create indexes on fields used in queries to speed up search operations.
  ```javascript
  db.collection.createIndex({ name: 1 });
  ```
- **Limit the Data**: Use `limit()` to reduce the size of the result set.

  ```javascript
  db.collection.find().limit(10);
  ```

- **Use Projection**: Fetch only the fields you need.

  ```javascript
  db.collection.find({}, { name: 1, age: 1 });
  ```

- **Avoid `$where`**: It’s slow since it uses JavaScript execution.

---

#### 6. **Joins in MongoDB (Including Pipeline)**

MongoDB doesn’t natively support SQL-style joins, but you can achieve joins using the `$lookup` stage in aggregation pipelines.

- **Example of `$lookup`**:
  ```javascript
  db.orders.aggregate([
    {
      $lookup: {
        from: "customers",
        localField: "customerId",
        foreignField: "_id",
        as: "customerDetails",
      },
    },
  ]);
  ```

---

### **NestJS / NodeJS Related Questions**

#### 1. **Diff Between Node.js and NestJS**

- **Node.js**: A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run server-side. It's based on the V8 engine and non-blocking I/O.
- **NestJS**: A framework built on top of Node.js that uses TypeScript and is heavily inspired by Angular. It provides an out-of-the-box architecture for building scalable and maintainable applications.

---

#### 2. **How Do You Call Microservices in NestJS?**

You can use **HTTP requests** or **message brokers** (like RabbitMQ, Kafka) to communicate with microservices in NestJS.

- **Example (HTTP Microservice)**:

  ```typescript
  @Controller()
  export class AppController {
    constructor(private readonly client: ClientProxy) {}

    @Get("microservice")
    async getHello() {
      return this.client.send("pattern", {});
    }
  }
  ```

---

#### 3. **Create an Express App with CRUD**

- **Example**:

  ```javascript
  const express = require("express");
  const app = express();
  app.use(express.json());

  let users = [{ id: 1, name: "Alice" }];

  app.get("/users", (req, res) => res.json(users));
  app.post("/users", (req, res) => {
    const newUser = req.body;
    users.push(newUser);
    res.status(201).json(newUser);
  });
  app.put("/users/:id", (req, res) => {
    const user = users.find((u) => u.id == req.params.id);
    if (user) {
      Object.assign(user, req.body);
      res.json(user);
    } else {
      res.status(404).send("User not found");
    }
  });
  app.delete("/users/:id", (req, res) => {
    users = users.filter((u) => u.id != req.params.id);
    res.status(204).send();
  });

  app.listen(3000, () => console.log("App listening on port 3000"));
  ```

---

#### 4. **Error Handling in NestJS**

NestJS uses **exception filters** to handle errors.

- **Example**: Custom error filter in NestJS:
  ```typescript
  @Catch()
  export class AllExceptionsFilter<T> implements ExceptionFilter {
    catch(exception: T, host: ArgumentsHost) {
      const ctx = host.switchToHttp();
      const response = ctx.getResponse<Response>();
      response.status(500).json({
        statusCode: 500,
        message: "Internal server error",
      });
    }
  }
  ```

---

#### 5. **Event Looping in NodeJS**

Node.js uses a **single-threaded event loop** to handle multiple requests concurrently by delegating non-blocking operations (like I/O) to the underlying system.

---

#### 6. **Asynchronous in NodeJS / Promise.all**

- **Asynchronous**: Node.js is non-blocking, which means operations like reading a file or making an HTTP request are asynchronous and don't block the execution of other code.
- **`Promise.all`**: It allows multiple promises to be executed in parallel, returning an array of results once all promises are resolved.
  ```javascript
  Promise.all([promise1, promise2]).then(([result1, result2]) => {
    console.log(result1, result2);
  });
  ```

---

#### 7. **require in NodeJS**

- **`require`** is used to import modules in Node.js. It can be used to import built-in modules, third-party modules, or your own modules.
  ```javascript
  const fs = require("fs");
  ```

---

### **ReactJS / General Programming Questions**

#### 1. **Does React Support SSR (Server Side Rendering)?**

Yes, React supports SSR through libraries like **Next.js** or by using `ReactDOMServer.renderToString` to render components on the server before sending them to the client.

---

#### 2. **Math.rand range**

You can use `Math.random()` and manipulate the result to get a number within a specific range.

- **Example** to get a random number between `min` and `max`:
  ```javascript
  const rand = Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;
  ```

---

#### 3. **Guards in NestJS and How They Work**

Guards are used to control the flow of requests and can be used for things like authentication, logging, or authorization.

- **Example** of a guard:
  ```typescript
  @Injectable()
  export class AuthGuard implements CanActivate {
    canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): boolean {
      const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
      return Boolean(request.user);
    }
  }
  ```

---

### **Other Topics**

#### **Lazy Loading in ReactJS**

Lazy loading in React allows you to split your code into smaller bundles that can be loaded as needed (usually on demand) using `React.lazy()` and `Suspense`.

```javascript
const SomeComponent = React.lazy(() => import("./SomeComponent"));
```

---

#### **Circular Dependency and How to Resolve That**

A circular dependency occurs when two or more modules depend on each other, creating a loop. This can cause errors or unexpected behavior.

- **Solution**: Use **dependency injection** or restructure your code to break the loop.

---

#### **The Two Beakers Puzzle**

To get exactly 4 liters using a 5-liter and a 3-liter beaker:

1. Fill the 5-liter beaker.
2. Pour from the 5-liter beaker into the 3-liter beaker until it is full.
3. Now, the 5-liter beaker has 2 liters.
4. Empty the 3-liter beaker.
5. Pour the remaining 2 liters from the 5-liter beaker into the 3-liter beaker.
6. Fill the 5-liter beaker again.
7. Pour from the 5-liter beaker into the 3-liter beaker until it is full.
8. Now, exactly 4 liters are left in the 5-liter beaker.

### **OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming)**

1. **What is Inheritance?**

   - **Answer:** Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows one class (child class) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from another class (parent class). It helps in code reusability and method overriding.

   **Example:**

   ```python
   class Animal:
       def sound(self):
           print("Animal sound")

   class Dog(Animal):  # Dog class inherits from Animal class
       def sound(self):
           print("Bark")

   dog = Dog()
   dog.sound()  # Output: Bark
   ```

2. **What is Polymorphism?**

   - **Answer:** Polymorphism refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same method or property in a way that is specific to their own class. This can be achieved through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) or method overloading (compile-time polymorphism).

   **Example:**

   ```python
   class Animal:
       def sound(self):
           print("Animal sound")

   class Dog(Animal):
       def sound(self):
           print("Bark")

   class Cat(Animal):
       def sound(self):
           print("Meow")

   def animal_sound(animal: Animal):
       animal.sound()

   dog = Dog()
   cat = Cat()
   animal_sound(dog)  # Output: Bark
   animal_sound(cat)  # Output: Meow
   ```

3. **What is a Class?**

   - **Answer:** A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects (instances). It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.

   **Example:**

   ```python
   class Car:
       def __init__(self, make, model):
           self.make = make
           self.model = model

       def start(self):
           print(f"The {self.make} {self.model} is starting")

   my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")
   my_car.start()  # Output: The Toyota Corolla is starting
   ```

4. **What are the properties of the class `Car`?**
   - **Answer:** The properties of the `Car` class could include:
     - `make` (brand of the car)
     - `model` (specific model of the car)
     - `year` (year of manufacture)
     - `color` (color of the car)
     - `engine_type` (e.g., petrol, diesel, electric)
     - `mileage` (miles per gallon)

### **HTML**

1. **Difference between HTML and HTML5?**
   - **Answer:** HTML5 is the latest version of HTML. Some key differences:
     - HTML5 introduces new semantic tags like `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, etc.
     - HTML5 supports multimedia elements such as `<video>`, `<audio>`, and `<canvas>`.
     - HTML5 has built-in support for local storage and offline capabilities.
2. **What is Doctype?**
   - **Answer:** `<!DOCTYPE html>` is a declaration that defines the document type and version of HTML being used. It helps the browser render the page correctly.
3. **Validations in HTML Elements?**
   - **Answer:** HTML elements can be validated using attributes like `required`, `minlength`, `maxlength`, `pattern`, `type`, etc.
     - Example: `<input type="email" required>`
4. **Disable all HTML Element Validations?**
   - **Answer:** You can disable HTML5 validation using the `novalidate` attribute on the `<form>` tag:
     ```html
     <form novalidate>
       <input type="email" required />
       <button type="submit">Submit</button>
     </form>
     ```

---

### **CSS**

1. **Any Framework Used?**

   - **Answer:** Some popular CSS frameworks are:
     - Bootstrap
     - Tailwind CSS
     - Bulma
     - Foundation

2. **Visibility: hidden vs display: none?**
   - **Answer:**
     - `visibility: hidden` hides the element, but it still takes up space in the layout.
     - `display: none` removes the element from the layout entirely, so it doesn't occupy space.

---

### **JavaScript**

1. **Var vs Let?**
   - **Answer:**
     - `var` is function-scoped and can be redeclared within the same scope.
     - `let` is block-scoped and cannot be redeclared within the same scope.
2. **Let vs Const?**

   - **Answer:**
     - `let` allows reassignment, but the variable itself cannot be redeclared within the same scope.
     - `const` is used for variables that should not be reassigned after initialization.

3. **Session Storage vs Local Storage?**

   - **Answer:**
     - `sessionStorage` stores data for the duration of the page session. It is cleared when the browser or tab is closed.
     - `localStorage` stores data with no expiration date. It persists even after closing the browser.

4. **Practical Test for Var, Let, Const?**

   - **Answer:**

     ```javascript
     var x = 10;
     if (true) {
       var x = 20; // Same variable due to function scoping
     }
     console.log(x); // Output: 20

     let y = 10;
     if (true) {
       let y = 20; // Different variable due to block scoping
     }
     console.log(y); // Output: 10

     const z = 30;
     // z = 40; // Error: Assignment to constant variable.
     ```

### **React**

1. **Advantages of React?**

   - **Answer:**
     - Component-based architecture
     - Virtual DOM for faster rendering
     - Easy to learn with reusable components
     - Strong community support and rich ecosystem

2. **React Lifecycle?**
   - **Answer:** React lifecycle methods include:
     - `componentDidMount()`: After component is rendered.
     - `componentDidUpdate()`: After component is updated.
     - `componentWillUnmount()`: Before the component is removed from the DOM.
3. **How to stop re-render in React?**

   - **Answer:**
     - Use `shouldComponentUpdate()` in class components or `React.memo()` in functional components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

4. **How does PureComponent work?**

   - **Answer:** `PureComponent` is a base class in React that performs shallow comparison of props and state to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

5. **What is Virtual DOM?**

   - **Answer:** The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM. React uses it to efficiently update the real DOM by only changing the parts that need to be updated.

6. **How is Virtual DOM better?**

   - **Answer:** The Virtual DOM improves performance by minimizing direct manipulations to the real DOM, which is slower.

7. **Disadvantages of React?**

   - **Answer:**
     - Steep learning curve for new developers.
     - Can lead to performance issues with large apps if not optimized properly.

8. **State Management Tool?**

   - **Answer:** Some popular state management tools for React include:
     - Redux
     - Context API
     - Recoil

9. **How to pass data from one component to another?**

   - **Answer:** Use props to pass data from parent to child components.

   **Example:**

   ```jsx
   function Parent() {
     const data = "Hello from Parent!";
     return <Child message={data} />;
   }
   function Child(props) {
     return <p>{props.message}</p>;
   }
   ```

10. **Are props mutable?**
    - **Answer:** No, props are immutable. They cannot be modified within the component that receives them.

3. **How to connect to Mongoose?**

   - **Answer:**
     ```javascript
     const mongoose = require("mongoose");
     mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost/mydatabase", {
       useNewUrlParser: true,
       useUnifiedTopology: true,
     });
     ```

4. **How to define API routes?**

   - **Answer:**
     ```javascript
     const express = require("express");
     const app = express();
     app.get("/api", (req, res) => {
       res.send("Hello World");
     });
     app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server running on port 3000"));
     ```

5. **Authentication in Node.js?**
   - **Answer:** You can use libraries like `Passport.js`, `jsonwebtoken`, or OAuth for authentication in Node.js.
