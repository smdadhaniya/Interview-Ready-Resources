## Differences Between HTML5 and Previous Versions of HTML

HTML5 introduced several new features and improvements over previous versions of HTML. Below are some key differences:

### 1. New Semantic Elements
HTML5 introduced new semantic elements that help improve the structure and readability of web pages:
- `<header>`: Defines a header for a document or section.
- `<footer>`: Defines a footer for a document or section.
- `<article>`: Represents independent content that can be distributed or reused.
- `<section>`: Defines a section in a document, used to group related content.
- `<nav>`: Represents navigation links.

### 2. New Form Elements
HTML5 provides new input types and attributes for forms, enhancing user experience and validation:
- `email`: For email address input.
- `date`: For selecting dates.
- `range`: For selecting a range of numbers.
- `tel`: For telephone numbers.

### 3. Multimedia Support
HTML5 offers native support for embedding audio and video, without requiring third-party plugins:
- `<audio>`: For embedding audio content.
- `<video>`: For embedding video content.

### 4. Canvas Element
- `<canvas>`: A powerful new element for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes, images, and text. It allows for drawing graphics directly in the browser via JavaScript.

### 5. Offline Storage
HTML5 provides client-side storage options for offline access to data:
- `localStorage`: Stores data with no expiration time.
- `sessionStorage`: Stores data for the duration of the page session.

### 6. Geolocation API
The Geolocation API allows web pages to access the geographical location of a user:
- This feature enables location-based services like maps, weather, and more.

### 7. Web Workers
Web Workers enable multi-threading in JavaScript, allowing scripts to run in the background without affecting the performance of the main page:
- This improves performance and responsiveness in complex web applications.

### 8. Improved Accessibility
HTML5 provides better support for accessibility, especially with ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications):
- ARIA roles and attributes enhance support for assistive technologies like screen readers.
