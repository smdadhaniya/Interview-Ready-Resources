üë®‚Äçüíª Basic Level JavaScript Interview Questions and Answers

Q1. What is JavaScript and its common uses?
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language used to create interactive effects within web browsers. It‚Äôs commonly used for DOM manipulation, form validation, animations, and API communication.

Q2. What are template literals in JavaScript?
Template literals are string literals allowing embedded expressions using backticks (`). You can interpolate variables using ${expression} syntax and write multi-line strings easily.

Q3. What is hoisting? Provide an example.
Hoisting is JavaScript's behavior of moving declarations to the top of a scope. Variables declared with var are hoisted and initialized as undefined, while let and const are hoisted but not initialized.

Q4. Difference between let, var, and const.

var is function-scoped and can be re-declared.

let is block-scoped and can be updated but not re-declared in the same scope.

const is block-scoped and cannot be updated or re-declared.


Q5. Data types in JavaScript.
JavaScript has 8 data types: string, number, bigint, boolean, undefined, null, symbol, and object. Primitive types are immutable; objects are reference types.

Q6. What is an array, and how to access its elements?
An array is a collection of ordered elements stored in a single variable. Elements can be accessed using zero-based indexing, e.g., arr[0].

Q7. Difference between == and ===.

== checks for equality after type coercion (loose equality).

=== checks for both value and type equality (strict equality).


Q8. Purpose of the isNaN function.
isNaN() checks whether a value is NaN (Not-a-Number). It's used to determine if a value can't be converted to a valid number.

Q9. What is null vs undefined?

null is an intentional absence of value (assigned).

undefined means a variable has been declared but not assigned a value.


Q10. Use of the typeof operator.
The typeof operator returns a string indicating the data type of a value, e.g., "string", "number", "object", "undefined".

Q11. Purpose of the map method in JavaScript.
map() creates a new array by applying a callback function to each element of the original array without modifying it.

Q12. Explain event bubbling and event capturing.
Event bubbling propagates from the innermost target to the outer elements. Capturing is the opposite: from the outermost to the target. You can control propagation using addEventListener's third parameter or event.stopPropagation().

Q13. What are higher-order functions? Provide an example.
Higher-order functions take other functions as arguments or return them. Example: Array.prototype.map, setTimeout, or a custom function like function logger(fn) { return fn(); }.

Q14. What is an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)?
An IIFE is a function that runs immediately after it's defined. Syntax:

(function() { console.log("Run now"); })();

Q15. Explain closures in JavaScript.
A closure is formed when a function retains access to its lexical scope, even after the outer function has returned. It enables private variables.

Q16. How do setTimeout and setInterval work?

setTimeout(fn, delay) executes once after a delay.

setInterval(fn, delay) executes repeatedly at set intervals.
Both use the event loop and timers queue.


Q17. Describe promises in JavaScript.
A promise represents a future value and has three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected. It‚Äôs used for handling asynchronous operations like API calls.

Q18. Use of async and await in JavaScript.
async declares a function that returns a promise. await pauses execution until a promise resolves, making asynchronous code look synchronous.

Q19. Difference between call, apply, and bind.

call invokes a function with a specific this and arguments.

apply is like call, but arguments are passed as an array.

bind returns a new function with this bound, but doesn‚Äôt execute it.


Q20. What is event delegation?
Event delegation allows a parent element to handle events from its child elements using event bubbling. It improves performance by reducing the number of event listeners.

Q21. Explain the event loop in JavaScript.
The event loop handles asynchronous operations by moving tasks from the event queue to the call stack when the stack is empty. It ensures non-blocking behavior in JS.

Q22. Difference between promises and async/await.
Promises handle async tasks using .then() and .catch(), while async/await provides cleaner, synchronous-style syntax. Both ultimately use the same underlying mechanisms.

Q23. Purpose of the reduce method in arrays.
reduce() executes a reducer function on each array element, returning a single accumulated result. It‚Äôs useful for sums, averages, and object transformations.

Q24. Explain currying in JavaScript.
Currying is converting a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions each taking a single argument. It enables partial application of functions.

Q25. What is a generator function and its usage?
A generator function returns an iterator and uses the function* syntax. It can pause execution with yield and resume later, useful for async flows or lazy evaluation.

Q26. What are weak maps and weak sets in JavaScript?

WeakMap holds key-value pairs with keys as objects, and doesn't prevent garbage collection.

WeakSet stores objects only, and also allows garbage collection.
They are non-iterable.


Q27. How does JavaScript handle memory management?
JS uses automatic garbage collection to reclaim memory. It identifies objects no longer referenced and clears them. Circular references can sometimes cause memory leaks.

Q28. Difference between shallow and deep copying.

Shallow copy copies only the first level (e.g., Object.assign, spread).

Deep copy duplicates all nested objects (e.g., structuredClone, recursion, JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))).


Q29. What is strict mode in JavaScript and how is it enabled?
Strict mode enforces stricter parsing and error handling. It‚Äôs enabled by adding "use strict"; at the top of a script or function to catch common coding mistakes.

Q30. Observer pattern and its relation to JavaScript.
The observer pattern allows an object (subject) to maintain a list of dependents (observers) and notify them of state changes. It's used in event systems, RxJS, and Redux.
