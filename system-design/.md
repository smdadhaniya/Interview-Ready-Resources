### 1. **What is the difference between API Gateway and Load Balancer?**

**API Gateway**:

- **Functionality**: An API Gateway acts as a single entry point for all client requests to a backend service, often routing, throttling, logging, and performing security functions like authentication and authorization. It may also aggregate multiple service calls into a single response.
- **Use Case**: Typically used in microservices architectures where requests need to be routed to specific services with added features like caching, rate limiting, or service discovery.

**Load Balancer**:

- **Functionality**: A load balancer distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed. It helps maintain application performance and availability by distributing traffic efficiently.
- **Use Case**: Primarily used in both traditional architectures and cloud environments to ensure high availability and scalability by balancing traffic to multiple instances of an application.

### 2. **What is the difference between Reverse Proxy and Forward Proxy?**

**Forward Proxy**:

- **Functionality**: A forward proxy sits between a client (like a web browser) and the internet. It forwards client requests to the destination server. It is often used to filter content or cache responses for clients.
- **Use Case**: Common in corporate environments to monitor, filter, or block access to certain websites or services, often used for anonymity or security.

**Reverse Proxy**:

- **Functionality**: A reverse proxy sits between clients and one or more backend servers, forwarding requests to the appropriate server. It is used to hide the identity and characteristics of the backend servers.
- **Use Case**: Commonly used for load balancing, security, caching, and acting as an entry point to multiple services in a microservices architecture.

### 3. **What is the difference between Horizontal Scaling and Vertical Scaling?**

**Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out)**:

- **Definition**: Involves adding more instances or servers to distribute the load. For example, adding more machines to a cluster to handle increased traffic.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for distributed applications and cloud environments where you can scale out easily (e.g., using container orchestration like Kubernetes).

**Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up)**:

- **Definition**: Involves increasing the resources (CPU, RAM, storage) of a single server to handle more load.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for monolithic applications or when you cannot easily distribute the load across multiple instances.

### 4. **What is the difference between Microservices and Monolithic architecture?**

**Monolithic Architecture**:

- **Definition**: A monolithic application is built as a single unit where all components are tightly coupled and run in a single process. All services are part of a single application.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for smaller, simpler applications where scaling and frequent changes are not a major concern.

**Microservices Architecture**:

- **Definition**: A microservices architecture splits an application into smaller, independent services, each responsible for a specific business capability. These services communicate over a network and are loosely coupled.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for complex, scalable applications where flexibility, independent scaling, and rapid development are required.

### 5. **What is the difference between Vertical and Horizontal Partitioning?**

**Vertical Partitioning**:

- **Definition**: Splitting data into different tables or databases based on columns. For example, separating user data (name, email, etc.) from transactional data (orders, payments).
- **Use Case**: Useful when different types of data are accessed at different rates, improving performance by reducing the amount of data each query needs to scan.

**Horizontal Partitioning**:

- **Definition**: Splitting data into different tables or databases based on rows. For example, splitting customer data by region (North America, Europe, etc.).
- **Use Case**: Useful for distributing data across multiple databases or servers to improve scalability, especially when there is a large amount of data.

### 6. **What is Rate Limiter? How does it work?**

A **Rate Limiter** controls the number of requests a client can make to a service within a specified time window (e.g., 1000 requests per minute). It is used to prevent abuse, protect services from excessive load, and ensure fair usage.

**How it works**:

- Rate limiters track the number of requests from each client, typically using a token bucket or leaky bucket algorithm.
- When the client exceeds the allowed request threshold, the service responds with an error (typically 429 - Too Many Requests).

### 7. **How does Single Sign On (SSO) work?**

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** allows users to authenticate once and access multiple applications or services without re-entering their credentials. It simplifies user experience and centralizes authentication.

**How it works**:

- When a user logs in, an identity provider (e.g., Okta, Google, or Active Directory) authenticates the user and creates an authentication token (e.g., SAML, JWT).
- This token is passed between different applications and services, verifying the user's identity without needing separate logins for each service.

### 8. **How does Apache Kafka work? Why is it so fast?**

**Apache Kafka** is a distributed event streaming platform used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications.

**How it works**:

- Kafka works by storing streams of records in **topics**. Producers send records to topics, while consumers read from topics.
- It uses a **publish-subscribe** model, where multiple consumers can read the same record, enabling high throughput.
- Kafka stores data across multiple servers and partitions, allowing parallel processing.

**Why itâ€™s fast**:

- **Immutable Logs**: Kafka stores data in logs, allowing quick writes and reads.
- **Partitioning**: Data is partitioned across multiple brokers, enabling parallel processing and horizontal scaling.
- **Replication**: Kafka replicates data across multiple brokers for fault tolerance, ensuring high availability without performance degradation.

### 9. **Difference between Kafka, ActiveMQ, and RabbitMQ?**

**Apache Kafka**:

- **Use Case**: High-throughput, fault-tolerant, and distributed event streaming.
- **Design**: Kafka uses a distributed commit log and is optimized for high-throughput and low-latency.
- **Message Delivery**: Messages are persisted and can be consumed multiple times by different consumers.

**ActiveMQ**:

- **Use Case**: A traditional message broker for queuing and point-to-point messaging.
- **Design**: Based on JMS (Java Message Service) and supports various protocols like MQTT, AMQP, and STOMP.
- **Message Delivery**: Supports both point-to-point (queue) and publish-subscribe (topic) messaging.

**RabbitMQ**:

- **Use Case**: A message broker that supports flexible routing and various messaging patterns.
- **Design**: RabbitMQ is based on AMQP and supports routing, message queues, and reliability.
- **Message Delivery**: Supports message acknowledgment, transactions, and complex routing mechanisms.

### 10. **Difference between JWT, OAuth, and SAML?**

**JWT (JSON Web Token)**:

- **Use Case**: A compact, self-contained token used to securely transmit information between parties, often used for authentication and authorization.
- **Purpose**: Primarily used for token-based authentication and authorization in web apps and APIs.
- **Format**: Encodes information in JSON format and is digitally signed or encrypted.

**OAuth**:

- **Use Case**: An authorization framework allowing third-party applications to access user data without exposing user credentials.
- **Purpose**: OAuth is used for delegated access to resources on behalf of a user (e.g., allowing a third-party app to access your Google contacts).
- **Flow**: OAuth tokens (access tokens)

grant temporary access.

**SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)**:

- **Use Case**: A protocol for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, typically between identity providers and service providers.
- **Purpose**: Commonly used for Single Sign-On (SSO) in enterprise applications.
- **Format**: Uses XML format to transmit authentication and authorization information.
