### Q.23 How do you make an HTTP request in Node.js?

**Answer:** You can make an HTTP request using the http or https modules, or by using third-party libraries like axios or request.

### Q.24 What is a promise in Node.js?

**Answer:** A promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation, providing then and catch methods for handling results and errors.

### Q.25 How do you create a promise in Node.js?

**Answer:** You can create a promise by instantiating a new Promise object and passing in a function that takes resolve and reject as arguments.

### Q.26 What are async/await in Node.js?

**Answer:** async/await are syntactic features in JavaScript that allow writing asynchronous code in a synchronous manner, using async to define a function and await to pause execution until a promise resolves.

### Q.27 What is a RESTful API?

**Answer:** A RESTful API is an architectural style for designing networked applications, using HTTP methods and URL endpoints to create, read, update, and delete resources.

### Q.28 How do you handle JSON data in Node.js?

**Answer:** JSON data can be handled using JSON.parse() to convert JSON strings into JavaScript objects and JSON.stringify() to convert objects into JSON strings.

### Q.29 What is middleware in Express.js?
