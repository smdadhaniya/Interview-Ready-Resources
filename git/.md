### 1. **git init**

- **Usage**: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

**Example**:

```bash
git init
```

### 2. **git clone**

- **Usage**: Clones a remote Git repository to your local machine.

**Example**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/repository.git
```

### 3. **git add**

- **Usage**: Stages a specific file to be included in the next commit.

**Example**:

```bash
git add index.html
```

### 4. **git commit -m**

- **Usage**: Commits the staged changes with a commit message.

**Example**:

```bash
git commit -m "Added new header to homepage"
```

### 5. **git push**

- **Usage**: Uploads local commits to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub).

**Example**:

```bash
git push origin main
```

### 6. **git pull**

- **Usage**: Fetches and integrates changes from the remote repository to your local branch.

**Example**:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

### 7. **git status**

- **Usage**: Shows the current state of the repository, including changes that are staged, unstaged, and untracked files.

**Example**:

```bash
git status
```

### 8. **git branch**

- **Usage**: Lists all branches in your repository or creates a new branch.

**Example**:

```bash
git branch
```

To create a new branch:

```bash
git branch feature/new-feature
```

### 9. **git checkout**

- **Usage**: Switches to a different branch in your repository.

**Example**:

```bash
git checkout feature/new-feature
```

### 10. **git merge**

- **Usage**: Merges the changes from one branch into another (usually from a feature branch into the main branch).

**Example**:

```bash
git merge feature/new-feature
```

### 11. **git log**

- **Usage**: Displays a list of all commits in the current branch’s history.

**Example**:

```bash
git log
```

### 12. **git reset**

- **Usage**: Unstages changes or reverts changes in your working directory.

**Example**:

```bash
git reset HEAD file.txt
```

**Example for soft reset**:

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

This undoes the last commit but keeps changes in the working directory, which is helpful if you want to modify or adjust the commit.

### 13. **git fetch**

- **Usage**: Downloads objects and refs from a remote repository but doesn’t modify your working directory.

**Example**:

```bash
git fetch origin
```

### 14. **git remote add**

- **Usage**: Adds a new remote repository to your local Git configuration.

**Example**:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repository.git
```

### 15. **git pull --rebase**

- **Usage**: Fetches changes from a remote repository and applies your local commits on top of those changes (instead of merging).

**Example**:

```bash
git pull --rebase origin main
```

### 16. What is the difference between git fetch and git pull?

**Answer**:

- **git fetch**: This command downloads new data (commits, branches, tags) from a remote repository but **does not** update your working directory or merge the changes. It allows you to see what’s been updated on the remote server without changing your local working state.

**Example**:

```bash
git fetch origin
```

This will update the remote-tracking branches but not modify your local working directory.

- **git pull**: This command is a combination of git fetch followed by git merge. It fetches the latest changes from the remote repository and merges them with your current branch. It modifies your working directory and can result in merge conflicts if there are changes on both the remote and your local branch.

**Example**:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

### 17. **Can you explain what a merge conflict is and how to resolve it?**

**Answer**:

- A **merge conflict** occurs when Git is unable to automatically merge two branches because the same part of a file has been modified in both branches. This is common when two developers work on the same lines of code, and Git doesn't know which change to keep.

**Example**: If you’re working on a feature branch and someone else makes changes to the same file in the main branch, when you try to merge the main branch into your feature branch, Git may not be able to automatically reconcile the changes.

**Resolving Merge Conflicts**:

1.  Git will mark the conflicted areas in the affected file, displaying <<<<<<<, =======, and >>>>>>> to indicate conflicting changes.
2.  You manually edit the file to resolve the conflict by selecting which changes to keep or merging them together.
3.  After editing, you stage the resolved file using git add:
    ```bash
    git add conflicted-file.txt
    ```
4.  Finally, commit the merge resolution:
    ```bash
    git commit
    ```

**Example of Merge Conflict:**

```text
<<<<<<< HEAD
console.log('This is the main branch');
=======
console.log('This is the feature branch');
>>>>>>> feature-branch
```

### 318. What is the difference between git reset and git revert?

**Answer**:

- **git reset**: This command is used to undo commits in your local repository. It moves the HEAD (the pointer to the current commit) to a specified commit. There are three main types of reset:

  - --soft: Resets the commit history but leaves changes staged.
  - --mixed (default): Resets the commit history and unstages changes.
  - --hard: Resets both the commit history and the working directory (warning: this can **delete changes permanently**).

  **Example**:

  ```bash
  git reset --hard HEAD~1
  ```

  This will move the HEAD one commit back and remove all changes in the working directory.

- **git revert**: This command is used to **undo a commit in a safe way** by creating a new commit that undoes the changes from a previous commit. Unlike git reset, git revert doesn't change the commit history but instead creates a new commit that reverses the effect of the specified commit.

**Example**:

```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
```

### 19. What is the purpose of git stash?

**Answer**:

- git stash is a command that temporarily saves changes that you don’t want to commit yet, allowing you to switch branches or perform other tasks without losing your work. You can then reapply the stashed changes later.

**Example**:

1.  Stash the current changes:
    ```bash
    git stash
    ```
2.  To see the stashed changes:
    ```bash
    git stash list
    ```
3.  To apply the changes back:
    ```bash
    git stash apply
    ```

### 20. What is the difference between a local branch and a remote-tracking branch?

**Answer**:

- **Local Branch**: A branch that exists in your local repository and is used for development. It tracks changes locally and can be pushed to a remote repository later.

**Example**:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
```

- **Remote-Tracking Branch**: A branch that reflects the state of a branch in a remote repository. It is not an actual branch but a reference to a remote branch (e.g., origin/main). These branches are used to track the progress of remote repositories.

**Example**:

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout origin/main
```

### 21. What is the purpose of .gitignore?

**Answer**:

- A .gitignore file is used to tell Git which files or directories to ignore in the version control process. This is useful for excluding files that are not relevant to the project (e.g., build artifacts, temporary files, IDE configuration files, etc.).

**Example**:

```bash
# Ignore all .log files
*.log

# Ignore the node_modules directory
node_modules/
```

**Use Case**: If you have log files or local configuration files (e.g., .vscode/, \*.pyc, node_modules/) that you don’t want to commit, you can add them to .gitignore to avoid accidentally adding them to the repository.

### 22. What does git merge --no-ff do?

**Answer**:

- **git merge --no-ff** ensures that a merge commit is created even if the merge could be fast-forwarded. By default, Git performs a **fast-forward merge** if the current branch has not diverged, meaning the branch can be updated directly without a merge commit.

**Example**:

```bash
git merge --no-ff feature-branch
```

### 23. How do you revert a commit that has already been pushed to a remote repository?

**Answer**:
If you’ve already pushed a commit and need to revert it, you can use the git revert command. This command creates a new commit that undoes the changes made in the specified commit, without altering the commit history.

**Example**:

```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
```

### 24. What is cherry pick?

**Answers**:

Git, cherry-picking is taking a single commit from one branch and adding it as the latest commit on another branch
