# React.js Interview Questions and Answers

### 1. **What is React?**

**Answer:**
React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications, where you need a fast, interactive experience. It allows developers to build components that efficiently update the UI using a virtual DOM.

---

### 2. **What is JSX in React?**

**Answer:**
JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript, which allows you to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript. React uses JSX to describe the UI structure, which is then transpiled into React elements.

---

### 3. **What are Components in React?**

**Answer:**
Components are the building blocks of a React application. They are reusable, modular, and self-contained units that define how a UI should appear based on the given props and state.

---

### 4. **What is the difference between Functional and Class Components in React?**

**Answer:**

- **Class Components:** Use ES6 classes, can manage state and lifecycle methods.
- **Functional Components:** Simpler components that were stateless before React 16.8, but now they can use hooks to manage state and lifecycle methods.

---

### 5. **What are React Hooks?**

**Answer:**
React hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features in functional components. Examples include `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`.

---

### 6. **What is the `useState` hook?**

**Answer:**
`useState` is a hook that lets you add state to functional components. It returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update it.

```js
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

---

### 7. **What is the `useEffect` hook?**

**Answer:**
`useEffect` is a hook that performs side effects in functional components, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manual DOM manipulations. It can be configured to run on mount, update, or unmount based on dependencies.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Component mounted!");
}, []);
```

---

### 8. **What is `useContext`?**

**Answer:**
`useContext` is a hook that allows functional components to consume context values. It provides a way to pass data through the component tree without explicitly passing props at every level.

```js
const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
```

---

### 9. **What is JSX and why is it used in React?**

**Answer:**
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows writing HTML-like code in JavaScript. It simplifies the structure of React components and makes them more readable.

---

### 10. **What are Props in React?**

**Answer:**
Props (short for "properties") are immutable data that are passed from a parent component to a child component. They are used to communicate between components.

```js
const Greeting = (props) => <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
```

---

### 11. **What is `key` in React and why is it important?**

**Answer:**
The `key` prop is used to uniquely identify elements in a list to help React efficiently update and reorder the list. It is important for performance optimization in dynamic lists.

```js
const items = [1, 2, 3].map((num) => <li key={num}>{num}</li>);
```

---

### 12. **What are Controlled Components in React?**

**Answer:**
A controlled component is an input element whose value is controlled by React state. The value is updated via the `setState` method, making React the "single source of truth."

```js
const [value, setValue] = useState("");
return <input value={value} onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} />;
```

---

### 13. **What are Uncontrolled Components in React?**

**Answer:**
An uncontrolled component is an input element that manages its own state internally using refs. React does not control its value.

```js
const inputRef = useRef();
<input ref={inputRef} />;
```

---

### 14. **What is the Virtual DOM in React?**

**Answer:**
The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. React updates the Virtual DOM first, and then efficiently updates the real DOM based on the differences (diffing algorithm), improving performance.

---

### 15. **What are Error Boundaries in React?**

**Answer:**
Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree and display a fallback UI. They are implemented using class components.

```js
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    // Handle error
  }
  render() {
    return this.props.children;
  }
}
```

---

### 16. **What is React Router?**

**Answer:**
React Router is a library that allows you to manage navigation and routing in React applications. It provides components like `<Route>`, `<Link>`, and `useHistory` to handle URL changes.

---

### 17. **What is the useRef hook?**

**Answer:**
`useRef` is a hook that allows you to persist values across renders without triggering a re-render. It is commonly used to reference DOM elements or store mutable values.

```js
const inputRef = useRef();
```

---

### 18. **What is Redux in React?**

**Answer:**
Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications. It provides a centralized store that holds the entire application's state and allows components to subscribe to changes and dispatch actions to modify the state.

---

### 19. **What are Higher-Order Components (HOCs)?**

**Answer:**
Higher-Order Components are functions that take a component and return a new component with additional functionality or props.

```js
const withLoading = (Component) => {
  return (props) =>
    props.isLoading ? <div>Loading...</div> : <Component {...props} />;
};
```

---

### 20. **What is the purpose of the `useMemo` hook?**

**Answer:**
`useMemo` is a hook that memoizes the result of a function and recomputes it only when its dependencies change. It's useful for optimizing expensive calculations.

```js
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => expensiveCalculation(a, b), [a, b]);
```

---

### 21. **What is the `useCallback` hook?**

**Answer:**
`useCallback` is a hook that memoizes a function and returns a new function only if one of its dependencies has changed. It is useful to prevent unnecessary re-creations of functions.

```js
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
  console.log("Clicked!");
}, []);
```

---

### 22. **What is React Suspense?**

**Answer:**
React Suspense is a feature that lets you handle the loading state for components that rely on asynchronous data fetching or code splitting. It allows you to show a fallback UI while waiting for resources.

```js
<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  <MyComponent />
</Suspense>
```

---

### 23. **What is React Server-Side Rendering (SSR)?**

**Answer:**
SSR refers to rendering React components on the server side instead of in the browser. It helps improve the initial load time and SEO for React applications.

---

### 24. **What is the difference between `componentDidMount` and `useEffect`?**

**Answer:**

- `componentDidMount`: A class component lifecycle method called after the first render.
- `useEffect`: A hook used in functional components for side effects, which can run on mount, update, or unmount based on dependencies.

---

### 25. **What is the difference between `componentWillUnmount` and `useEffect` cleanup?**

**Answer:**

- `componentWillUnmount`: A class lifecycle method called just before a component is unmounted.
- `useEffect` cleanup: In functional components, the `useEffect` hook allows you to clean up resources or cancel subscriptions when the component unmounts.

---

### 26. **What is the `shouldComponentUpdate` method in React?**

**Answer:**
`shouldComponentUpdate` is a lifecycle method in class components used to determine whether a component should re-render based on changes in props or state.

---

### 27. **What is a Context API in React?**

**Answer:**
The Context API allows you to share values (like themes or user authentication) between components without prop drilling. It provides a way to pass data through the component tree directly.

---

### 28. **What are Pure Components in React?**

**Answer:**
A PureComponent is a class component that only re-renders when its props or state change, using a shallow comparison to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

---

### 29. **What is the purpose of the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prop?**

**Answer:**
`dangerouslySetInnerHTML` allows you to inject raw HTML into a component. It should be used cautiously to avoid Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

```js
<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: "<strong>Hello</strong>" }} />
```

---

### 30. **What is the difference between `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect`?**

**Answer:**

- \`

useEffect\`: Runs asynchronously after the render cycle.

- `useLayoutEffect`: Runs synchronously after the DOM has been painted but before the browser has painted the screen.

---

### 31. **What are React Fragments?**

**Answer:**
React Fragments let you return multiple elements from a component without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

```js
return (
  <>
    <h1>Title</h1>
    <p>Content</p>
  </>
);
```

---

### 32. **What is Prop Drilling in React?**

**Answer:**
Prop drilling refers to the process of passing props from parent components down to deeply nested child components, which can make the code difficult to maintain. Context API or Redux can help avoid prop drilling.

---

### 33. **What is the difference between `map` and `forEach` in React when rendering a list?**

**Answer:**

- `map`: Returns a new array and is commonly used for rendering lists in React.
- `forEach`: Does not return anything and is generally not used for rendering lists in React.

---

### 34. **What is the significance of `React.StrictMode`?**

**Answer:**
`React.StrictMode` is a wrapper component that helps identify potential problems in an application during development. It does not affect the production build.

---

### 35. **How does React handle state updates asynchronously?**

**Answer:**
React batches state updates for performance optimization. State updates are not immediately reflected in the component; instead, React schedules the update and performs it in batches.

---

### 36. **What are the advantages of using React?**

**Answer:**

- Component-based architecture.
- Efficient re-rendering with Virtual DOM.
- Declarative UI design.
- Strong community and ecosystem.
- Support for hooks for state and side effects management.

---

### 37. **What is the `ReactDOM.render` method used for?**

**Answer:**
`ReactDOM.render` is used to render a React component into a DOM element. It typically acts as the entry point for rendering the React component tree.

```js
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

---

### 38. **What is Code Splitting in React?**

**Answer:**
Code splitting is a technique where your application is divided into smaller bundles that are loaded only when needed. React supports this using `React.lazy()` and `Suspense`.

---

### 39. **What is the significance of the `defaultProps` in React?**

**Answer:**
`defaultProps` is used to define default values for props in case they are not provided by the parent component.

---

### 40. **What is the difference between `==` and `===` in React?**

**Answer:**

- `==` performs type coercion and compares values after converting them to the same type.
- `===` is the strict equality operator and compares both value and type.

---

### 41. **What is the purpose of `componentDidUpdate` in React?**

**Answer:**
`componentDidUpdate` is a lifecycle method in class components that is invoked after the component has updated (i.e., after state or props changes).

---

### 42. **What is `componentDidCatch` in React?**

**Answer:**
`componentDidCatch` is a lifecycle method in class components used for error handling. It is called when an error is thrown in any child component.

---

### 43. **What is Static Rendering in React?**

**Answer:**
Static rendering refers to pre-rendering HTML at build time, usually done by frameworks like Next.js for faster loading and better SEO.

---

### 44. **What is React Concurrent Mode?**

**Answer:**
React Concurrent Mode is an experimental feature designed to improve rendering performance by allowing React to interrupt rendering and prioritize updates.

---

### 45. **What is React’s `memo` function?**

**Answer:**
`React.memo` is a higher-order component that optimizes performance by memoizing the component and preventing unnecessary re-renders when the props have not changed.

---

### 46. **What is the purpose of `flushSync` in React?**

**Answer:**
`flushSync` is used to flush updates to the DOM synchronously in React, ensuring that the update happens before the next render cycle.

---

### 47. **What is the difference between `setState` and `useState`?**

**Answer:**

- `setState` is used in class components to update the state.
- `useState` is used in functional components to add state.

---

### 48. **What are the different types of component updates in React?**

**Answer:**

- **State updates**
- **Props updates**
- **Force updates using `forceUpdate`**

---

### 49. **What is the `React.createContext` method?**

**Answer:**
`React.createContext` is used to create a Context object. It allows you to share values (like themes or authentication) between components without explicitly passing them as props.

---

### 50. **How does React handle component re-rendering?**

**Answer:**
React re-renders components when their state or props change. It compares the new virtual DOM with the previous virtual DOM to determine the changes that need to be applied to the real DOM (diffing algorithm).
