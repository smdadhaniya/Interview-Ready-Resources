Q1. What is React?
React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, especially SPAs. It uses a component-based architecture and a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI.

Q2. What is JSX?
JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It‚Äôs a syntax extension that allows writing HTML-like code within JavaScript, making UI code more readable and expressive.

Q3. What are components in React?
Components are reusable building blocks in React. They can be either functional or class-based and help organize the UI into isolated, manageable pieces.

Q4. What is the difference between a controlled and uncontrolled component?
A controlled component's value is managed by React state, while an uncontrolled component maintains its own state through the DOM using refs.

Q5. What is the virtual DOM?
The virtual DOM is a lightweight in-memory representation of the real DOM. React updates the virtual DOM first, then calculates the most efficient way to update the real DOM.

Q6. What are props in React?
Props (short for properties) are read-only inputs passed to components. They allow data to flow from parent to child components.

Q7. What is the difference between state and props?
Props are passed externally to a component, while state is managed internally. Props are immutable; state can be updated via setState or hooks.

Q8. Why is it recommended to keep components pure?
Pure components return the same output for the same input, which improves predictability, testability, and performance by reducing unnecessary re-renders.

Q9. What are keys in React?
Keys help React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed in a list. They should be unique and stable (e.g., IDs).

Q10. How do you conditionally render components in React?
You can use ternary operators, logical AND (&&), or conditional statements to render components based on conditions.

‚öôÔ∏è React Hooks

Q11. What is the use of useState hook?
useState allows you to add state to functional components. It returns an array with the current state and a function to update it.

Q12. What does the useEffect hook do?
useEffect handles side effects in functional components such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manual DOM manipulations.

Q13. What is the purpose of useRef?
useRef provides a way to persist values across renders and directly access DOM elements or mutable values without causing re-renders.

Q14. When would you use useMemo?
useMemo memoizes expensive computations, preventing them from running on every render unless their dependencies change.

Q15. How does useCallback differ from useMemo?
useCallback memoizes functions, while useMemo memoizes return values of functions. useCallback(fn, deps) is equivalent to useMemo(() => fn, deps).

Q16. What is a custom hook?
A custom hook is a reusable function that encapsulates logic using built-in hooks. It allows sharing logic across components.

Q17. Can hooks be used in class components?
No, hooks are exclusive to functional components. Class components rely on lifecycle methods instead.

Q18. Why must hooks be called at the top level?
Hooks must be called in the same order on every render, and calling them conditionally would break React‚Äôs internal hook state.

Q19. How does useLayoutEffect differ from useEffect?
useLayoutEffect runs synchronously after all DOM mutations but before the browser paints. useEffect runs after paint and is non-blocking.

Q20. What is the purpose of useReducer?
useReducer is an alternative to useState for managing complex state logic. It follows the reducer pattern like Redux.

üß¨ State Management

Q21. What are some popular state management libraries for React?
Redux, Zustand, Jotai, Recoil, MobX, and Context API are widely used for managing state across components.

Q22. How does Redux work with React?
Redux uses a single global store, reducers to manage state transitions, and actions to trigger changes. React connects to it using react-redux.

Q23. What are the drawbacks of prop drilling?
Prop drilling makes components tightly coupled and hard to maintain, especially when passing data deeply through component trees.

Q24. How does Context API solve prop drilling?
Context API allows you to create a global state accessible by any component without passing props manually.

Q25. What is a reducer function in React?
A reducer is a pure function that takes the current state and an action and returns the new state.

üìà Performance Optimization

Q26. How do you prevent unnecessary re-renders in React?
Use React.memo, useMemo, useCallback, and ensure props/state don‚Äôt change unnecessarily.

Q27. What is React.memo?
React.memo is a higher-order component that memoizes a component, preventing re-renders unless its props change.

Q28. What is code-splitting in React?
Code-splitting lets you load components lazily using React.lazy and Suspense, improving initial load performance.

Q29. What is lazy loading in React?
Lazy loading defers loading non-critical components or resources until they‚Äôre needed, improving performance and UX.

Q30. What is the purpose of shouldComponentUpdate?
In class components, shouldComponentUpdate controls whether a re-render should occur based on changes in props/state.


---

üîÑ Lifecycle Methods

Q31. What are the phases of the React component lifecycle?
The three phases are mounting, updating, and unmounting. Hooks or class lifecycle methods are used to manage these.

Q32. What is the equivalent of componentDidMount in hooks?
Use useEffect(() => { ... }, []) for logic that runs once after the component mounts.

Q33. What lifecycle method is called before unmounting?
componentWillUnmount in class components, or useEffect cleanup function in hooks.

Q34. When is getDerivedStateFromProps used?
It's used to update state based on prop changes before rendering, but it's rarely recommended due to complexity.

Q35. Why is componentDidUpdate used?
It executes after an update and can be used for operations like fetching data when props/state change.

üåê Routing (React Router)

Q36. What is React Router?
React Router is a library for declarative routing in React applications, enabling navigation between different components.

Q37. How do you implement dynamic routing in React Router?
Use route parameters like /user/:id and access them using the useParams() hook.

Q38. What is the difference between Link and a tag in React Router?
Link performs client-side routing without reloading the page, while <a> tag triggers a full page reload.

Q39. What is useNavigate in React Router v6?
useNavigate replaces useHistory and allows programmatic navigation to different routes.

Q40. How do nested routes work in React Router?
Nested routes allow components to render inside parent routes using Outlet and a nested route configuration.


---

üåç Context API

Q41. What is the Context API?
The Context API allows passing data through the component tree without manually passing props at every level.

Q42. How do you create and use a context?
Create a context using React.createContext, wrap the component tree in a Provider, and access it via useContext.

Q43. Can Context API be used with hooks?
Yes, you can consume context in functional components using the useContext hook.

Q44. What is a Provider in Context API?
A Provider is a component that supplies context values to its child components.

Q45. What are some limitations of Context API?
Context re-renders all consuming components on any change, which can cause performance issues in large applications.

üß™ Testing React Apps

Q46. What tools are commonly used for testing React apps?
Jest (test runner), React Testing Library (DOM testing), and Enzyme (component testing, though now less popular).

Q47. How does React Testing Library differ from Enzyme?
React Testing Library focuses on testing user behavior and accessibility rather than component internals.

Q48. How do you test a component with props?
Render it with desired props using a testing tool and assert expected outputs or behaviors.

Q49. What is snapshot testing in React?
Snapshot testing captures a rendered component‚Äôs structure and compares it to a saved snapshot to detect unexpected changes.

Q50. How do you mock API calls in tests?
Use tools like Jest's jest.mock, msw (Mock Service Worker), or manually stub fetch/axios calls to simulate API responses
